# Langtons-Ant
This project is my attempt at making Langton's Ant. The Ant follows two simple rules: 
1. If the ant is on a white cell, it turns it black then turns 90 degrees clockwise and moves forwards
2. If the ant is on a black cell, it turns it white then turns 90 degrees counter-clockwise and moves forwards
It repeats these steps forever.
